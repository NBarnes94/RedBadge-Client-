Welcome to Media warehouse

Purpose
This App was created for my final project with Eleven Fifty's Web development course ending in July 2021

So what does it do?
    Its an app similar to good reads but has submissions for movies and video games. Users can see a catalog of all the pieces of media that have been created by all other uses. They are also able to edit delete and create their own submissions. There is some minimal admin privileges added so that all submissions can be moderated for duplicates and correct information

This project was deployed with heroku at https://nab-media-app-try3.herokuapp.com/?fbclid=IwAR1NaYwiX7v2H7gbOdHPxuVFlrtlUgiNbZN4jNPM3d42WuwpA4xD4vHiy80

Style
This app was styled by using a mix of Material-Ui and Reactstrap 

Database origin
    all information is built and housed through this code for the serve that i wrote here (https://github.com/NBarnes94/Redbadge-final-project-server-try2)
